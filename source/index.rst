Welcome to the 2019 Chapter 30 MMA Transit Project Scoring User Guide
=================================================================

MMA is an anlytical lens and spatial/network analysis toolkit developed
by Renaissance Planning Group to facilitate accessibility analysis for
multimodal transportation and land use planning applications. 

The first half of this guide provides an overview of the key terms and 
concepts behind accessibility analysis, the basics of analyzing accessibility,
and the details of working with the MMA geoprocessing toolbox.

The Maryland Chapter 30 scoring process is a legislatively-mandated 
scoring system for evaluating transportation projects.  The Chapter 30 
scoring model evaluates projects across nine goals and twenty-three
measures that were established in statute, using a combination of 
project data, modeling analysis, and qualitative questionnaires.

The second half of this guide focuses on the step-by-step process for
developing accessibility scores for Chapter 30 transit project applications.
