Chapter 30 Transit Project Report
=====================================

Transit project scoring results are assembled into a document that contains key information about the project,
data development and assumptions made for accessibility scoring, quality assurance mapping, and summaries
of the accessibility impact findings.  The report is organized into 5 sections, as outlined below.  A brief
description of the content expected in each section is provided here.

Links to the 2019 Transit Project Reports are also provided below for reference.
